✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Understand this workspace

The workspace demonstrates how we can share context between the host and apps (all apps use the same version of the library - 'singleton'),
and from the other hand use the same UI components library on build time but not on run time (each app has its own version of the library)
take a look at the configuration at `module-federation.config.js`

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Running

Run `nx serve host --devRemotes="insights,supply-chain"` to serve on http://localhost:4210 .

## Common libs

### Common-ui
a shared library with UI elements, the library ***is not shared*** at runtime
### Common-context
a shared library with React context providers, the library ***is shared*** at runtime
